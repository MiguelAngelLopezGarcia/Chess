# Chess Game
> Made from theodinsproject.com course.

I made this project from the Ruby section of the webpage: https://www.theodinproject.com/

It was quite a challenge to made it but finally, after more than a month I did
it!

I started creating the grid and setting all the pieces in it. After that I implemented
all the pieces movements and the more important thing: the checks. This part drove me 
crazy for days but I managed to think in a good solution without changing a lot the
way I intended the code to work. Finally I added some color (in order to see properly the
pieces) and depurated some repeated code. I didn't implemented the AI because it is not
funny to play against a random machine (at the moment I don't know how to do a good AI).

I really hope you enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it! And if you are here
to get some ideas I hope to be helpful :)
